###About the app
Ucompare is a mobile application that helps students search for and compare colleges through custom filters.  

Features

Ucompare allows users to apply filters to their college search, including location, financial aid, tuition, student body size, etc. Once a user finds a college he wants to learn more about he can either 1) select the college to see further details, 2) choose to compare that college with up to three other colleges or 3) bookmark that college to look at it later.

Ucompareâ€™s compare feature gives users a visual representation of how up to four different colleges compare with each other in terms of size, tuition, financial aid, etc. 

The bookmark feature allows users to keep their college search more organized through custom folders.
